Three steps:
1. Run the jobs in P{rocessing test to make ntuples
2.Then got Derivation/run/Scale to modify and run prepare samples to preseloect events for the calibration
3. Then go to src under Scale and do make (This is standalone C since I have a way to run it on GPU as well )
   then run for  ./calibrate  ../file.root 
   thne you get the calibration.root that can be moved to Derivation/data for people to use 
4. Then you get the closure after calibrating the muons with The Derivation software
